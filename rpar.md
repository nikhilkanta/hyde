This is a record of the research papers that I randomly or sometimes not so randomly come across in my quest to find some answers. As I am mostly inclined towards the study of Data Sciences, Dynamical systems and Network theory, most of my papers would be relating to them. I am also interested in the study systems on non-flat metric, which is mostly worked in General Relativity.
