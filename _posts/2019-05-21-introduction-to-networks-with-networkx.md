A Network or a Graph is a structure that contains a set of objects and how these objects
in some sense are related to each other. These objects in the network are represented by
what are called as node or vertex and the relations between them are represented by lines
connecting them called as edges.

For example, a network can represent the devices that
are connected in Internet, or the citations of scholarly papers through bibliographic references
or the species of animals that are connected by links telling which species feeds on
which other species.



## Seven Bridges of Konigsberg

The first problem of network can be traced to the problem of the Seven
Bridges of Koenigsberg which was solved by Leonhard Euler in a paper published in 1736
to give the negative resolution to the problem with the help of a graph. The problem was to
find a path over the four landmasses which was connected by seven bridges such that one
crosses a bridge only once, to show that this cannot be done for that particular topology he
constructed a network to show it.
